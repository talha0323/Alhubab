            Thoughts from the founder
        </div>
        <div class="missionline">
            <p>ALHUBAB is the dream-child of a market visionary Jamshed Hasan a marketing man with over three decades
                experience and exposure to vital media functions. He has held senior positions in India’s better known
                media organizations, and has been commended by his peers for his dedication, initiative, applied
                knowledge and achievements on Public Relations. In the course of his long career, he has come across a
                wide variety of Senior Executives holding key positions in the industry and commerce, and effectively
                learned how to cope with their egos.</p>
            <p>Jamshed Hasan has been associated first with space marketing (advertising) of leading publications like
                Associated Journals Limited (publishers of National Herald, Qaumi Awaz and Navjeevan) then with Delhi
                Press Patra Prakashan Limited (publisher of Sarita, Mukta, Grihshobha, Champak, Woman’s Era and Alive)
                and later with the Times of India Group’s Saturday Times, Sunday Review, Femina and Filmfare in Mumbai.
                During the association with the Times of India Group at Mumbai, he was the one, who for the first time
                during the long history of more than 150 years, roped in the chairman’s speech advertisement in the
                Illustrated Weekly of India which was appreciated by the management and the then Editor-in-Chief Mr.
                Pritish Nandy.</p>
            <p>After working for nearly three years in the Times of India in Mumbai, the management transferred him to
                Patna with bigger responsibilities as Operations Head where his sincerity and hard work brought laurels
                for him in international conferences of the organization. After streamlining the Operations he was given
                the responsibility of development where his job has involved achievements of Group Targets, control of
                the Sales team and monitoring their performances and activities related to advertising, marketing, sales
                and administration.</p>
            <p>Being an ambitious person Jamshed Hasan was not satisfied with his work profile and the career growth in
                Patna and decided to move to a bigger market and as Delhi was near and thus was his next destination.
                Delhi was a new market for him and, so, as he was for the Delhi market. But he could find out some way
                to rope in himself and joined S. Chand & Company Ltd .a leading textbook and engineering book publisher
                to look after their two competition monthlies Competition World and Pratiyogita Sagar. Here he
                introduced a very new concept of advertising by selling book-covers of leading titles to relevant
                advertisers. And then moved to Indian Express (Mumbai) Limited based at Delhi as Head of Operations
                monitoring and responsible for the states like UP, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan apart from Delhi
                being the Head Office.</p>
            <p>During the year 2005, Sahara Group was on expansion plan of their Urdu media – Roznama Rashtriya Sahara
                and was looking for a professional like him. Jamshed Hasan joined Sahara Group as Head – Sales &
                Marketing, Urdu media where apart from their three existing editions, he launched their seven more
                editions from Mumbai, Kolkata, Patna, Ranchi, Hyderabad, Bangalore & Kanpur. Jamshed Hasan was with
                Sahara Group till 2011 and gave a hopping growth of more than 1000% to their business as compared to the
                revenue he inherited in 2005.</p>
            <p>In 2011, Jamshed Hasan left Sahara Group and joined Mid-Day Info-Media Ltd (Jagran Prakashan Group) to
                shoulder the responsibility of another Urdu product entering into North market – INQUILAB and joined
                them as Assistant General Manager-Marketing with all India responsibilities. Here, too, Jamshed Hasan
                proved himself to the expectations of the management and after working for a brief period of about three
                years, moved back to Sahara Group with the same responsibility of Urdu media in 2013 end.</p>
            <p>After an association for more than one and half decades of exposures in Urdu media, Jamshed Hasan has
                realized that since the independence in 1947, during the last 74 years our leaders never thought and
                realised that there is a strong need and scope of Urdu language publication in the market which can
                truly speak about the community in their own language and raise the issues of the community.</p>
            <p>NOW, Jamshed Hasan has decided to branch of on his own so that the society and its people and the
                organizations can benefit from the richness of his knowledge and experiences……...</p>
            <p>Thus ALHUBAB, a very strong Urdu media vehicle started with a purpose ……to cater to the needs of the Urdu
                readers in general and minorities in particular and become the part of national development.</p>
